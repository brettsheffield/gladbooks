README

The clerk daemon (clerkd) is part of gladbooks, and exists to run various periodic and triggered tasks.  clerkd listens on a TCP socket (Default: localhost, port 3141).

== Status ==

Like the rest of gladbooks, clerkd is still under development and is incomplete.

== Access Control ==

There isn't any - yet.  clerkd will accept commands from anyone able to connect.  Either listen only on localhost or control access using a firewall.  This isn't a big concern, as clerkd doesn't accept arbitrary commands, only triggers.  When triggered, clerkd connects to the gladbooks database to determine what, if anything, it should do.

== Command-line arguments ==

clerkd start
- start the daemon, listening on the ip/port specified in the config.

clerkd stop
- stop the daemon.

clerkd status
- report whether the daemon is running, and how many hits (connections) it has handled.

== Commands ==

When connected to clerkd (telnet to the host/port where it is listening), the following TEXT commands (followed by a newline) are understood:

NOOP - do nothing, successfully
QUIT - close connection with clerkd
GO   - triggers a batch run.  clerkd will connect to the gladbooks database and figure out what, if anything, it needs to do.

== Building and Installing ==

make

make test 
- (optional) runs tests

make leakcheck
- (optional) runs test suite under valgrind to check for leaks and errors

make install
